Space-time complexities are represented in Asymptotic notations:

1. Big-O Notation(O-notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - best case complexity
3. Theta Notation (Θ-notation) - Average case complexity

Big-O Notation has two important characteristics

1. It is expressed in terms of the input
2. It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details

Time complexity :
O(n) - Linear complexity
O(1) - Constant complexity
O(n2) - Quadratic complexity
O(n3) - Cubic complexity
O(logn) - Logarithmic complexity( when input size reduces by half every iteration)

Space complexity:
O(n) - Linear complexity
O(1) - Constant complexity
O(logn) - Logarithmic complexity. Note: try to avoid other complexities.
